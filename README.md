This is an open-source tool used to apply an ASCII art filter onto any source video, including a live camera output. It leverages the [Depth Anything V2]([url](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2)) deep learning model and OpenCV's computer vision library in Python to convert video content to ASCII art based on brightness and estimated depth.
