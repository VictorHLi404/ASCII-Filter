This is an open-source tool used to apply an ASCII art filter onto any source video, including a live camera output. It leverages the [Depth Anything V2]([url](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2)) deep learning model and OpenCV's computer vision library in Python to convert video content to ASCII art based on brightness and estimated depth of objects in frame.

**The program is relatively resource-heavy due to the cost of running the local deep learning model on your machine. If it runs slowly, please give it time to load.**

To run the program, do the following:

1.0: If on a device that contains an NVIDIA GPU that supports CUDA, follow the instructions to [download the CUDA driver]([url](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads))
1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
